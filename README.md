# Epicodus Track Suggestor
#### _This app will help you decide which programming language is right for you_

### Created by Matt Groberg on 1/18/2019

## Description
Towards the end of the Epicodus coding bootcamp, students will have the option to choose from one of the following programming languages (css/design, php/drupal, Java/Android, c#/.NET, or Ruby/Rails).
This App is designed _using modals_ to only show you up to five relevant questions. Each modal has a question, a select input, and button to submit. When the program has reached a decision, the modals will disappear, it will reveal the track at the bottom of the page.
